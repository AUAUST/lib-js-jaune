# jaune

A toolkit for working with colors in JavaScript.

## Installation

```sh
pnpm add @auaust/jaune
```

or if you prefer Yarn:

```sh
yarn add @auaust/jaune
```

## Environment Support

`jaune` is compatible with all modern browsers. Since it doesn't use any advanced APIs, it is likely to work on older browsers as well, but it hasn't been tested. If it doesn't work on your browser but you think it should, please feel free to contribute!

It also works in Node.js environments, and is fully implemented in TypeScript.

## Sponsor

This library is a project by us, [AUAUST](https://auaust.ch/). We sponsor ourselves!
